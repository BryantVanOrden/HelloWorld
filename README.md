# Overview

This is a Simple program that most engineers first learn to program. It is something I wanted to make a short video on.

This uses visual studio code which is free to everyone to write the simple python code printing of Hello World

This was to help me get comfortable with making videos and talking about code. It also is to help anyone who doesn't already know python.
